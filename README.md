# pla-device

This repository contains the source code for the PLA ALT gaming controller.

The source code is compiled using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). The "board" is equivalent to SparkFun Pro Micro 8MHz, see [this](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro--fio-v3-hookup-guide/) guide for configuring the IDE for the board.

The `caterina` folder contains a custom bootloader for the device. With this bootloader, the device can be put into programming mode by holding down the right joystick as the device is plugged in.
